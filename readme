# What is this?
A tool for sharing knowledge within Artsy

The goal is to have a slack integration such that we can say things like:

`/kb write: how do I add gravity interop to a new repo?`
`/kb lookup: gravity`

and it would walk you through an interface.

* interface: slack
* interface: html renderer
* interface: API

# Data Layer
We'll use Hasura for our data layer, which lets us build out postgres tables and then 
automagically generates graphQL queries and mutations for us.

### Next Steps
1. Make sure we're happy with schema in Hasura (add concepts of users? repos? commits for examples?)
2. Expose an API via the endpoints in this project to allow HTTP access over read/write
3. Write a slack app which reads/writes to our middleware app (this)
4. Middleware can also render web views of entries etc.
